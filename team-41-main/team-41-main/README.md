**AI Assitant for Innovative Learning**

**Problem**
When an individual want to learn some technology, he/she want to reach the goal in the quickest and most fun way possible

**Solution**

Input: the technology a user wants to achieve
Create/load the skill tree required to achieve the target
Get the current skill set
> Option 1: from EPAM platform(people.epam.com)

> Option 2: by interacting with the user

Create a road map (based on the difference between the required and current skill sets):
Generate learning material
Generate a practical task
> Option 1: create several small tasks for each skill separately

> Option 2: create a single task that covers more tasks

Answer the user's questions along the way:
Check the task and provide constructive feedback
Check not only implementation correctness, but also how well it covers the technology being learned

Ways of improvement:
Despite the current idea allows to get the knowledge, it's not a very fun way
Implementing Personalization: We can suggest a task based on person's interests
For example, the task could be a simple game
or an interactive storytelling app
Compete with other users
Assign badges or points for user to motivate learning more
